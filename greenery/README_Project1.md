1. 130 users. *Query: SELECT count(user_id), count(distinct user_id) FROM dbt_shoham_g.g_users;*
2. 7.52 (rounded). *Query: SELECT AVG(count_orders) FROM (SELECT date_trunc('hour',created_at), count(distinct order_id) as count_orders FROM dbt_shoham_g.g_orders GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1) s;*. Normally wouldn't jump right to average in case there were missing hours with no orders, but since our dataset has every hour in it it's okay.
3. 3.89 days (Rounded). *Query: SELECT AVG(delivered_at - created_at) FROM dbt_shoham_g.g_orders;*. Noting some nulls here that might affect this.
4. 1 order: 25 people, 2 orders: 28 people, 3+ orders: 71 people. *Query: SELECT case when orders = 1 then '1 order' when orders = 2 then '2 orders' when orders >= 3 then '3+ orders' ELSE 'hmmm' end as order_cat, count(distinct user_id) FROM (SELECT user_id, count(distinct order_id) as orders FROM orders GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1) s GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;*

Normally wouldn't jump right to average in case there were missing hours with no orders, but since our dataset has every hour in it it's okay.
