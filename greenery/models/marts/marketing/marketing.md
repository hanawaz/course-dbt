# Marketing Data Mart

The marketing data mart contains fact and dimension tables that can be used to measure the efficacy of our marketing efforts. 

Included in this Data Mart are:
 * `fct_promo_revenue`

 I would've liked to have added more here. A user order fact table would be the obvious addition. Also would be useful to include some sort of intermediate table that shows the item price versus the discounted item price. Will likely add when I refactor later in the week.
